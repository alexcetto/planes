# Project Planes


## Description
This is a project proposed by Polytech Marseille and made by Adrien and me on a period of around two months.
The project is a search engine in Java with an IHM and is designed to learn the concepts of POO and Design Patterns.
I deleted the access to the database now that the project is public, but I'll add the SQL file in _DATA for those who want to test it.


## Continuity
There are a lot of possible improvements on this project, first in security (which was not really the scope of the project), IHM, requests optimization but we don't have the time to continue modifyining it now.
This code lacks a lot of commenting, sorry.


## For the curious
- First install the SQL file in a MySQL server.
- Change the info in the User.GlobalConnector class.
